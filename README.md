# FormsJS

Working with entire HTML forms can be tedius and time consuming. Many of the tools that exist today are built for individual form elements (text boxes, radio buttons, check boxes, etc). FormsJS is the tool that works across the entire form. Using FormsJS, entire forms can be populated with default data, validated across all fields, and serialized as an object to be passed to the server.
